# Hey folks 👋🏻

I'm Matteo Bonfadini, Mathematical Engineering student at Politecnico di Milano.
My studies are focused on Computational Science and Computational Learning.

## 🎓 **Education**

 - Bachelor / Master of Science Mathematical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano

## 📌 **Some interesting projects**

- [`MATLAB Hackathon 27/05/2023 winning project`]([https://github.com/teobucci/slhd](https://github.com/BonfaTex/MATLABthon-27-05-23)): Developed data analysis through MATLAB Mobile App in order to speak without speaking (for istance, using a remote control device).
- [`Advanced Computational Mechanics Report (... comings soon)`](): Analyzed a system of nonlinear equations using both Fortran and Matlab; Solved various potential problems using the BEM method.

## 🛠️ **Be different**
During my MSc studies, I'm going to differentiate as mush as possible. In this regard I am ready to accept Internship offers, Summer Camps, Exchange Programs and so on. My aim is to put myself at the forefront in computational science fields, such as computational biomedicine and computational mechanics, or statistical fields.
